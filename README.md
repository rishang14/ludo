Note: All of these code every single line of logic and architecture is written by me without help of any ai tools cuz i don't use it 

Ps: i am not gonna tell you about the ui portion 🫡🫡

I built a real-time multiplayer Ludo game with custom game engine, WebSocket networking, Redis-based state management, turn validation, pawn capture logic, and scalable room-based broadcasting, fully production-oriented. 

Feature : 

 1.Designed a complete Ludo game engine with turn-based rules, dice logic, and move validation 
 
 2.implemented real-time multiplayer sync using WebSockets with game-room isolation
 
 3. Built server-authoritative gameplay to prevent cheating and invalid moves
  Modeled board state & pawn state using optimized maps for O(1) lookups
 
 4. Implemented pawn capture, safe cells, home & finish logic correctly

5. Used Redis as a shared game state store for fast reads and updates

6. Designed join/exit flow with access validation per game & user

7. Implemented movable pawn calculation per turn based on dice value

8. Built turn locking, dice roll permissions, and move gating

9. Added broadcast system to sync board updates to all players instantly

10. Structured backend with Game Manager, WebSocket Gateway, and Redis Layer

11. Built frontend using React + Zustand for deterministic state updates

12. Ensured stateless HTTP + stateful WebSocket architecture
